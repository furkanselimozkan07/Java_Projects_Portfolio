About This Repository
This repository is a comprehensive portfolio of my Java programming work. Each project reflects my dedication to writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code, with a focus on:

Data Structures & Algorithms: Implementations of essential algorithms and data structures, showcasing problem-solving skills.
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: Projects applying AI concepts, including simple machine learning models and data analytics.
Real-World Applications: Code that tackles everyday challenges, showcasing the potential of Java in diverse fields like data processing and automation.
Project Highlights
Algorithm Implementations
A collection of classic algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) implemented in Java, with time complexity analysis and comments for easy understanding.

Data Structures Library
Custom implementations of data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

AI Applications

Simple Machine Learning Models: Linear regression, classification models, etc., developed from scratch.
Data Analysis: Examples of data analytics in Java, including dataset preprocessing and visualization.
Real-World Solutions
Projects inspired by real-life issues, such as file processing, data transformations, and automation scripts.

Technologies & Libraries
This portfolio emphasizes vanilla Java with no external libraries unless otherwise stated in individual project directories. Some projects may include:

Java SE for core development
JUnit for testing
JavaFX for GUI-based applications
Maven/Gradle for dependency management
Setup & Installation
To clone and run the projects locally:

bash
